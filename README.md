# Shell Collection  
First creates a list of shells that the user enters counts for how many there are of each. Creates a tuple of the names and amounts, and assuming Puka 
shells are worth $1.00 each, Cone shells $1.50 each, Driftwood $0.50, Sea Glass $2.00 and Starfish $2.50, it creates a list of tuples containing name, amount,
and cost. 

Prints out a bar graph with the distribution of the collection of shells.
